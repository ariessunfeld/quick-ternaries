# Launcher

The launcher folder contains the minimal distribution for the application. `launcher/requirements.txt` should just contain the `requests` module, as this is the only third-part library needed for `updater.py` to run.

In the future, if `updater.py` becomes more complex, add any third-party libraries required for this file to run to the `launcher/requirements.txt` file.

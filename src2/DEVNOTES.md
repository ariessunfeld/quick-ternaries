- view8.py is the version that was built in Dec 2024
- view9.py is intermediate and not meant to run
- view10.py implements a robust centralized trace editor data model that supports plot type changes
- view11.py builds on view10.py and introduces the setup menu, also designed with plot type switching in mind. However, it is bare bones and doesn't currently perform plot type switch modification.
- view12.py introduces better selection of columns for axes etc, and removal of data from data library, but has a bug when switching plot types wrt setup menu
- view13.py introduces plot type switching on the setup menu, and saving/loading but it's preliminary and buggy
- view15.py fixes save/load bugs across trace editor and setup menu; also improves tab renaming and preserves order across save/load
- view16.py adds heatmap-specific widgets that display only when the heatmap checkbox is toggled
- view17.py introduces groupbox clustering for dependent widgets. Groupboxed widgets appear below the rest of the form.
- view18.py introduces filters!
- view18b.py fixes filter renaming
- view19.py : bug fixes
- view22.py syncs the data library with the selection options per trace and handles deleting loaded files gracefully
- skip view23*.py
- view24.py introduces a connection between selected datafile and heatmap options via a trace editor controller
- view25.py: skip
- view26.py adds sizemap configuration and connects datafile to sizemap
- view27*.py was complicated, claude fixed bugs: heatmap selection column persists through loading workspace, advanced settings added
- view28.py fixes bugs where creating new tab would not populate heatmap fields
- view29.py improves filter sync with available cols as well as during loading of workspace
- view30.py introduces more advanced color picker
- view31.py introduces point shape selection using nice visible shapes
- view32.py introduces colorscale selection using visible scales
- view32b.py fixes this with a better dropdown
- view33c.py introduces more advanced heatmap options but has a datafile column selection bug
- view34.py fixes the datafile selection bug
- view35.py: Somehow heatmap col was not preserved after load; commenting part of post_load_fix helped
- view36.py reimplemented sheet and header selection on loading datafiles, and updated all column-getting function calls to respect new datafilemetadata object, as well as to/from dict method modifications
- view36b.py Realized that heatmap options werent populating when adding a file normally and creating a trace; needed to make modifications
- view38.py Fixed bugs that had been introduced for adding files normally; missing data will now prompt user to select new location for file. validation method now returns a mapping of filenames. No known bugs.
- view39.py revamps the filter logic to better handle val1 val2 visibility
- view40.py improves filter logic by considering colun dtype when determining operation options, and other enhancements. Also adds multi field selector support and fixed filter loading with a dedicated from_dict method.
- view41.py improves datafile handling by creating local copy dataframe and only updating when load is pressed (THANK YOU CLAUDE 3.7 Thinking!!!)
- view42.py adds bootstrap widget support to the trace editor model - first draft
- view42a.py fixes the javascript integration - most advanced, but buggy beyond repair
- view42b.py fixes bug where plot html is contantly being reset to placeholder text and contour widgets are not displaying
- view43.py want to branch off of 41.py and rebuild plotting, then introduce bootstrapping, then contour trace widgets
- view41-plot-2.py is the most stable version, going back to basics and implementing plotting etc manually
- view41-plot-2a.py is trying to add hover data to the setup menu
- view41-plot-2b.py moves the hover data below the axis selection, and fixes visibility connection
- view41-plot-3.py ditches the goal of hiding the hover data and makes some improvements to other setup menu widgets. Is the most mature, stable version at the moment.
- view41-plot-4.py improves on its predecessor by adding the option to scale apices in the setup menu with elegant widget handling
- view41-plot-5.py INTEGRATES PLOTTING FOR THE FIRST TIME!!! Some bugs in the column scaling, and some things not propagating through to the plot or being handled together, but WOO!!
- view41-plot-6.py fixes bug where scaling widgets break; there is still a bug where some things are not connected to the plot AND a weird one where after loading a workspace, axis label changes do not take effect
- view41-plot-7.py fixes the bug about loading workspace
- view41-plot-8b.py fixes bug where after switching plot type, column scaling widgets for old plot type still showed
- view-A.py : naming had gotten messy; starting fresh with this version. Future versions will increment the letter. Fixed advanced setup menu connections.
- view-B.py connects point selection with javascript and PlotlyInterface. Style changes to buttons in the bottom banner.
- view-C.py uses isort and black to clean up code and imports, and docformatter to handle long docstrings and comments. Fixes bug where column scaling wasn't getting included in the save file. And fixed bug where scale factors were displaying with too much precision (tens of decimals) in plot
- view-D.py - implements valid formula specification in the trace editor. Has bugs: Font color is not connected; molar conversion widget does nto repopulate after loading workspace; molar conversion widget not connected through to trace making process.
- view-E.py fixed filters by incorporating dtype consideration; fixed color button opacity selection (storage and application), molar conversion repopulation bug fixed (still not connected to trace maker)
- still view-E.py added fancy window title font and link
- view-F.py attempts to add contours using Claude. A lot of the integration is good, but the app becomes very laggy and the prompt neglected to request an implementation of error-entry
- view-E-2 implements bootstrapping! Yay! Except adding a trace and clicking Bootstrap is laggy. Trying to do performance optimization in next version and defer havy workload to Render calls. Also need to do smoething better to auto-populate the error fields.
- view-E-3 fixed it but then was accidentally overwritten by re-running the command cp view-E-2.py view-E-3.py :(
- view-E-4 takes a different approach: Starting with view-E, trying to pad on the contour functionality by hand using the tips from Claude that were implemented in view-E-3 (before overwrite accident)
- view-E-4.py fixed bugs it's awesome
